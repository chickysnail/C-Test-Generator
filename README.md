# C-Test-Generator
Makes texts with blanks in words according to the C Prinzip

# Rules of the C Test from Wikipedia: 
The test consists of at least four texts with twenty to twenty-five gaps that must be filled in by the subject. Whole words are never omitted; at least one, often several letters of the word are given. This ensures that only one correct solution is possible.

## To run the generator
add a normal text into the texts folder, and change the path string in the main.py
The new text will be created in the same folder
